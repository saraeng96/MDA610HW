### Assignment 4 (due October 8)
1. Read the following topics in [Python Tutorial](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_course.php).
	- The Origins of Python
	- Indentation
	- Data Types and Variables
	- Operators
	- Sequential Data Types: Lists and Strings
	- List Manipulations
	- Shallow and Deep Copy
	- Input via the keyboard
	- Output with Print
2. Take Quiz 3 on Blackboard. 
3. Create a Jupyter notebook. Write a Python snippet in a code cell, respectively, to solve each of the following problems. Use Markdown cells and comments to add necessary notes and text. 
  	1. Ask the user to input a string. Then output a reverse copy of the string. (Hint: the reverse of string `abc` is `cba`.)
  	2. Create a list that contains values 1, 2 and 3. Ask the user to input a number. Append the number to the end of the list. Output the average of the four numbers in the list. 
  	3. Ask the user to input the radius of a circle. Use the literal `pi` defined in the `math` module to compute the area of the circle. Finally, output the area.
  	4. Ask the user to input a number. Assign this number to variable `x`, use the literal `e` defined in the `math` module to compute `e` raised to the power of `x` and assign the result to variable `y`. Finally, output both the natural logarithm and the common logarithm of `y`.
4. Refer to Step 4 and Step 5 in Assignment 3. Create a `hw4` directory in your local repo. Copy the Jupyter notebook you created above to the `hw4` directory. Then upload the file to your remote repo.
