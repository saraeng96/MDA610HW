### Assignment 3 (due October 1)
1. Read [Git Book, Sections 2.5, 2.6, 3.1 to 3.4](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).  
2. Read [the 3 simple rules to follow when using Git and GitHub](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/follow-these-simple-rules-and-youll-become-a-git-and-github-master-e1045057468f). Understand the GitHub flow.
3. Read the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) handed out in class.
4. A remote repo "MDA610HW" was created before. You uploaded the content of a local repo to this remote repo and later downloaded the remote changes in class. Please use these two repos (one remote and one local) in Step 4 and Step 5. In the local repo, create a directory `HW3`. Within the directory, use `sublime` or another text editor to create a Markdown file with filename `README.md`. Use Markdown to style the text so that the file contains at least
	* a title
	* an ordered list of six or more commonly used git commands
	* a link

(Hint: you may download this README.md file to your local computer and then revise it.) 
Next, publish your `README.md` file on GitHub (Hint: stage and commit the changes in the local repo and then upload the committed changes to the remote repo). 

5. After finishing Step 4, click the `HW3` directory in the remote repo. You shall see the content of the `README.md` file. Finally, email the instructor the URL of your remote repo before the class on Tuesday, October 1 (please include "MDA610 HW3" in your email's subject line).
